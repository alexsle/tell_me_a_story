Later on c1 called the nearby at1 pizza place to order some food. After a few long seconds c3 picked up the phone saying - Hi! Welcome to at1 pizza, can I take your order? c1 said - Please, I would like 2 large cheese pizzas with t2 and t1 on it. Sauce on the side please! Ok, darling - said c3 - but we are all out of t2. Can I offer you blue cheese instead?! c1 hanged up the phone and cried.
